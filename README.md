💡 Project Goal

The goal was to transform a traditional board game into an **immersive experience**. Instead of just making another Tic-Tac-Toe, this version tells a story — a duel between magic and might — all within a web browser.

📸 Visuals

Imagery, animations, and character art make the game feel alive. The board isn't just a grid; it's an arena. The moves aren't just clicks; they're magical moves cast in a battle.
